CSI2372 - Advanced Programming Concepts with C++ (Fall 2015)

This project is a console game for 2-4 players which is played on a game board (a grid of squares). Each player receives a random set 
of cards (each card contains 1-4 animals) and a secret unique animal. The players take turns. At each turn, the players will have 
the opportunity to place a card on the grid, as long as it "matches" the adjacent card. In addition to the regular cards, action cards 
exist as well which can turn the game around by performing different actions on the players' cards. A player wins if there are 7 cards 
that contain his unique animal on the board. The game can also be saved and loaded back.
